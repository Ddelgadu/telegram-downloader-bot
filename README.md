A Telegram bot for file downloading automation 

If you have got an Internet connected computer or NAS and you want to automate file downloading from Telegram channels, this bot is for you.

Just create a new Telegram bot (https://core.telegram.org/bots), edit this script and fill in the fields TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID. Change the download directory (DOWNLOADS_FOLDER) is desired.

Install the python bot library, from Gihub (https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) or using pip ( https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-telegram-bot/)

Run the script and talk to your new bot!

You can:

* Copy a file post from a channel and share it with your downloader bot
* Say "?" to your bot to check how many downloads are waiting in its queue
* Say "quit" to stop the bot
